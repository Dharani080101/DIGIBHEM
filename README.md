**Fake News Detection**
This project focuses on developing a robust fake news detection system leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. Utilizing freely available datasets like the "Fake News Detection Dataset" from Kaggle, I have preprocessed the text data by removing stopwords, stemming words, and employing vectorization methods such as TF-IDF. 
The extracted features are then used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, renowned for its ability to capture sequential dependencies in text data.We evaluate model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the effectiveness of our fake news detection system. 
Contributions are encouraged, whether in the form of implementing new features, optimizing existing code, or experimenting with different models and datasets. 
Together, we strive to combat misinformation and promote truth and credibility in online content.
